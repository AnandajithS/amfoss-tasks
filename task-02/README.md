# Introduction
For starting this task,we needed to first clone the Terminal-Chaos repository into our system using the command ```git clone```. I then created a **handbook** folder to store my codes and screenshots.
## Part 1 
Using ```cd``` and ```ls``` commands, I explored the various folders within the directory. Then, in **Entrance3** of **'The Eolian Caves'**, I found two text files named **parchment.txt** and **Statue of Marika.txt**. Using ```cat``` command, I read the contents of **parchment.txt** and found the code, hence completing part 1
## Part 2
For this part, I used ```git checkout``` to switch to **The-Light-Realm**. Next, I needed to find the names of the text files containing both the words *good* and *holy*. I tried to use ```grep```, but I didn't know how to include multiple arguments. So, I searched the internet and found about the ```xargs```. Using that and ```--include==*.txt```,I was able to view the text files having both the words. The files were **Moonbloom** and **Mistveil**.Following the key, I found the holy spell. Then using ```cd``` command, I explored the various directories and sub-directories, I finally found a file called **KharnoktheBloodForged.py**.On executing it, the boss battle began. After successfully parrying him and stunning him, I used the holy spell to defeat him. After he was defeated, I obtained the Celestial Veil Amulet and The Light Book, thus completing Part 2
