## What are your thoughts and feedback on the Praveshan selection process?
This selection process pushed me out of my comfort zone. There were some tasks, which I thought would be difficult but turned out to be quite simple while others looked like it would be piece of cake, but actually turned out to be quite challenging. I was often frustrated at times. But, I was able to learn and discover various new things while doing these tasks. I would like to thank my mentor, Swayam, for clearing my doubts and helping me out. Overall, I think this process was quite exciting.
